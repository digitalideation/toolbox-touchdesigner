## **ğŸ•˜ Morning Session (3 hours) â€“ Understanding the Interface & Navigation**

**Objective:** Get familiar with the **TouchDesigner interface, node-based workflow, and operator families**.

### **ğŸŸ¢ Part 1: Introduction to the TouchDesigner Interface (30 min)**

ğŸ”¹ What is TouchDesigner? Overview of real-time visual programming.  
ğŸ”¹ Exploring the **Network Editor, Parameters, and Timeline**.  
ğŸ”¹ **Navigating** the interface (zooming, panning, and selecting).



ğŸ“Œ **Hands-on Exercise:** Open TouchDesigner and explore the **default project**. Modify an existing node, tweak parameters, and preview changes.

---

### **ğŸŸ¡ Part 2: Understanding Operators & Network Anatomy (30 min)**

ğŸ”¹ The **5 Operator Families**:

- **TOPs (Texture Operators)** â€“ image/video processing
- **CHOPs (Channel Operators)** â€“ signal processing & animation
- **SOPs (Surface Operators)** â€“ 3D modeling & geometry
- **DATs (Data Operators)** â€“ working with text & tables
- **COMPs (Component Operators)** â€“ UI elements & containers

ğŸ”¹ **Reading Networks**: Understanding node connections, flow, and dependencies.  
ğŸ”¹ How to **connect, rearrange, and rewire operators** effectively.

ğŸ“Œ **Hands-on Exercise:**

- Create a **simple network** with different operator families.
- Observe how data flows from one node to another.

---

### **ğŸŸ  Part 3: Creating & Connecting Operators (45 min)**

ğŸ”¹ Adding **new operators** to the network.  
ğŸ”¹ **Cooking process**: How TouchDesigner updates nodes dynamically.  
ğŸ”¹ Bypass, Delete, and Replacing Operators efficiently.  
ğŸ”¹ Using the **Viewer Active Mode** to preview results.

ğŸ“Œ **Hands-on Exercise:**

- Create a **TOP network** that loads an image and applies a basic effect.
- Experiment with **connections** and **node order**.

---

### **ğŸ”µ Part 4: Operator Families Deep Dive (45 min)**

Each group will create **mini-projects** using different operator families:  
âœ… **TOPs:** Load an image, apply color adjustments, and transform it.  
âœ… **CHOPs:** Generate a sine wave and manipulate it in real-time.  
âœ… **SOPs:** Create basic 3D shapes and modify them.  
âœ… **DATs:** Display text dynamically.  
âœ… **COMPs:** Build a simple UI with a button and slider.

ğŸ“Œ **Challenge:** Combine multiple operators and **animate** a simple effect.

---

## **ğŸ•’ Afternoon Session (3 hours) â€“ Working with Images (TOPs)**

**Objective:** Learn how to import, manipulate, and process images/videos.

### **ğŸŸ¢ Part 1: Importing & Manipulating Images (45 min)**

ğŸ”¹ **Loading images** into TouchDesigner (Movie File In, Webcam Feed, etc.).  
ğŸ”¹ Adjusting **Resolution, Format, and Color Space**.  
ğŸ”¹ Using **Transform TOP** for scaling, rotation, and positioning.

ğŸ“Œ **Hands-on Exercise:** Import an image and modify it using **Transform & Level TOPs**.

---

### **ğŸŸ¡ Part 2: Basic Compositing, Mattes & Masks (1 hour)**

ğŸ”¹ **Compositing techniques**: Overlays, blending modes, transparency.  
ğŸ”¹ Creating **masks** for selective image effects.  
ğŸ”¹ Using **Ramp TOP, Noise TOP, and Threshold** to define masks.

ğŸ“Œ **Hands-on Exercise:**

- Blend two images together with **different blend modes**.
- Create a **mask** using a custom shape.

---

### **ğŸŸ  Part 3: Building Patterns & Applying Effects (45 min)**

ğŸ”¹ Using procedural **Noise & Ramp** textures.  
ğŸ”¹ Creating **animated visuals** with feedback loops.  
ğŸ”¹ Applying effects like **Blur, Edge Detect, and Glow**.

ğŸ“Œ **Hands-on Exercise:**

- Build a **dynamic background pattern** using Noise TOP.
- Add **feedback effects** for motion trails.

---

### **ğŸ”µ Part 4: Saving & Exporting (30 min)**

ğŸ”¹ Capturing visuals as **images or videos**.  
ğŸ”¹ Adjusting settings for performance optimization.  
ğŸ”¹ Best practices for **real-time rendering**.

ğŸ“Œ **Final Challenge:**

- Apply everything learned today in a **mini-project**:  
   ğŸ”¹ Load an image, add effects, and export the result.  
   ğŸ”¹ Present the **before & after** versions.

---

### **ğŸ“Œ Summary of Day 1**

âœ… Navigating TouchDesigner & understanding the interface.  
âœ… Learning the **5 operator families**.  
âœ… Working with **images, masks, and effects**.  
âœ… Hands-on **mini-projects** for real-time visuals.
