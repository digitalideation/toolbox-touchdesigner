### **🎯 Morning Session: Interface & Core Concepts**

#### **🟢 Exercise 1: The Reverse Engineering Challenge (30 min)**

**Objective:** Improve **observation & troubleshooting** skills by recreating an unknown network.

🔹 **How it works:**

- Prepare a **pre-built** TouchDesigner network (a simple visual effect, animation, or UI).
- Remove all labels and operator names.
- Split participants into **teams** and provide each with the project file.
- Their goal: **Reverse engineer** the effect and explain how it works.

✅ **Takeaway:** Helps understand **node flow**, operator families, and debugging.

#### **🟡 Exercise 2: Operator Scavenger Hunt (45 min)**

**Objective:** Learn **operator functionality** in an engaging way.

🔹 **How it works:**

- Prepare a **list of specific visual effects** (e.g., "Apply a blur effect", "Distort an image", "Animate a shape").
- Each team must **find the right operators** and build a small network to achieve each effect.
- They **document** their findings (operator name, key parameters, why they chose it).
- After 30 minutes, each team presents one of their discoveries.

✅ **Takeaway:** Encourages exploration & problem-solving.

### **🎨 Afternoon Session: Working with Images (TOPs)**

#### **🟠 Exercise 3: The Visual Remix Challenge (1 hour)**

**Objective:** Explore **image manipulation & compositing** in a fun way.

🔹 **How it works:**

- Provide each team with a **random set of images** (or allow them to bring their own).
- They must **remix** them creatively using **TOPs** (compositing, effects, masking, etc.).
- Each team presents their **before & after transformation**.

💡 **Variation:** If you want more interactivity, let them integrate **live webcam feeds**.

✅ **Takeaway:** Reinforces **TOP workflows** and creative problem-solving.

#### **🟢 Exercise 4: Generative Pattern Duel (45 min)**

**Objective:** Explore **procedural visuals** with a fun competition.

🔹 **How it works:**

- Each team is given 30 minutes to create a **dynamic pattern** using **Noise TOP, Ramp TOP, Feedback TOP, etc.**.
- They **customise it** (colors, motion, interaction).
- At the end, the groups **battle**:
  - Two teams present their patterns side by side.
  - Participants **vote** (e.g., most hypnotic, best color use, most unexpected).

✅ **Takeaway:** Encourages exploration of **procedural textures** & real-time animation.

---

#### **🟡 Exercise 5: Team Animation Relay (45 min)**

**Objective:** Learn **collaborative animation creation**.

🔹 **How it works:**

- Teams start with a **blank canvas**.
- Every **10 minutes**, they pass their project to another team, which must **add a new element or effect**.
- The process repeats **3 times**.
- At the end, all teams present their **unexpected final animation**.

✅ **Takeaway:** Encourages **collaborative creativity** and **layered design thinking**.

### **💬 Group Discussion Topics**

- **"What makes a TouchDesigner project easy to read?"**  
   ➝ Talk about **best practices** for structuring networks, using annotations, and organizing workflows.
- **"How would you use TouchDesigner in your own work?"**  
   ➝ Get participants to **brainstorm creative uses** in different industries (VJing, data visualization, installations, etc.).
- **"What challenges do you face as a beginner?"**  
   ➝ Open discussion to **identify common struggles** and **share problem-solving strategies**.

## **⚡ Bonus: Daily Wrap-Up Challenge**

At the end of the day, have a **15-minute "One-Minute Project"** challenge:  
📌 Each team **creates a quick 10-second animation** using what they learned that day.  
📌 They **export it as a video** and showcase it in a mini "film festival" at the end.
