## Day 3: UI, Python, and Advanced Topics

### 🕘 Morning Session (3 hours) – UI, Python, and External Data

📌 **Objective:** Introduction to building custom interfaces, Python scripting, and integrating external data.

#### 1️⃣ Building Interactive UI Panels (30 min)

🔹 Creating **Button, Slider, Container COMPs**  
🔹 Binding UI elements to parameters dynamically  
🔹 Customizing panel layout and functionality

#### 2️⃣ Python Scripting Basics (30 min)

🔹 Writing Python expressions & scripts within TouchDesigner  
🔹 Accessing and modifying parameters dynamically  
🔹 Automating tasks using Python

📖 **Reference:**
